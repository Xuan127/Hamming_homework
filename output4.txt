The conversation indicates a new pathway in the decision tree where the caller provides the issue spontaneously after being asked if it's an emergency. To accurately represent this in the decision tree, we need to add two new edges:

1. From node '12' ("Asks if this is an emergency") to node '3' ("Inquires about air conditioning services") when the condition is "No and caller provides issue".

2. From node '3' to node '14' ("Offers to have an agent call back to assist further") on the condition "Callee responds".

Here are the new edges to be added:

```json
{"source_id": "12", "target_id": "3", "condition": "No and caller provides issue"}
{"source_id": "3", "target_id": "14", "condition": "Callee responds"}
```
